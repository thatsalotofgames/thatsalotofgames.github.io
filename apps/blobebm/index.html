    <h1>Welcome to BlobeBM!</h1>
    BlobeBM is an HTML program that runs bookmarklets in about:blank. It's very
    useful if bookmarklets don't work on your device or if they are blocked by
    your administrator. While the purpose of bookmarklets is lost in BlobeBM,
    (that is, being able to run code in any website) some bookmarklets are still
    useful and fun to mess with!
    <h3>Please allow popups on this page to launch BlobeBM.</h3>

<Line id='0'>Ah, so you came here at last. We've been wondering whether another foolhardy warrior, ever thirsty for glory, would pay us a visit.

Stay awhile, stranger, and listen.</Line>

<Line id='1' Quest='A Lost Tome'>There is great evil lurking in the underbelly of this accursed cathedral. Dreadkeep, we call it. We saw many a hero enter that gate, never to return.

I doubt I'd ever see you again, either.

But, on the off chance that you make it back, I want you to bring me something.

It's a large leatherbound tome, with a bookmark fashioned after a human tongue. A grisly image, I know.

You don't strike me as a squeamish kind, though.</Line>
